Before running indexer, files to be indexed need to be placed in developer/DEV/ folder.  
An example would be:
    developer\DEV\aiclub_ics_uci_edu\8ef6d99d9f9264fc84514cdd2e680d35843785310331e1db4bbd06dd2b8eda9b.json

To index run index.py. If you have previously ran the indexer or any of the folders the indexer uses are populated, you will be prompted before the indexer clears these folders.

To run search engine in command line run search.py

To run search engine in local webrowser run app.py and connect to localhost:5000.
